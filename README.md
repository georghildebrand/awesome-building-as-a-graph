# awesome-building-as-a-graph

A curated list of ressources about using graphs to represent data in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) domain. Testing again


## Research groups and projects

- [Topologic](https://topologic.app/); Research Group focussing on topological aspects.

### Workshops and Conferences

- [LDAC - Linked Data in Architecture and Construction](http://www.linkedbuildingdata.net/ldac/index.html); The LDAC workshop series provides a focused overview on technical and applied research on the usage of semantic web, linked data and web of data technologies for architecture and construction (design, engineering, construction, operation, etc.)


## Tools and Technologies

- [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM)

- [Topologic](https://topologic.app/software/); Software for

- [IFCOpenShell](https://ifcopenshell.org/); Open Source IFC toolkit and geometry engine. Helpful when integrating graphs with IFC.
- [linked data bim web applicatoin](https://ld-bim.web.app/); Online tool to render IFC files and query these (e.g. via SPARQL)
